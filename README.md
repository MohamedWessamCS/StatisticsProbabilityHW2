1. 12C4,4,4 = 12! / (4! * 4! * 4!) = 34650

2. In a seperate file

3.1 = P(A) = 4C2 / 12C2 = 1/11, P(B) = 8C2 / 12C2 = 14/33
3.2 = (4C2 / 12C2) + (4C1 * 8C1 / 12C2) = 1 - P(B) = 19/33

4.1 = 10C3 / 15C3 = 24 / 91
4.2 = 5C1 * 10C2 / 15C3 = 45 / 91
4.3 = 1 - 10C3 / 15C3 = 67 / 91

5. 2/3

6.1 = 5/8
6.2 = 1/2
6.3 = P(A' intersect B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' U B') = 5/8 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 5/8
6.4 = 1/2
6.5 = 3/8 - 1/2 = - 1/8 which is not correct, which concludes that A is subset of B
6.6 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0

7. P(atleast 7) = 1 - P(No 7) = 1 - (30/36)^3 = 91/216

8.k^2 - 8 = 1, k^2 = 9, k = 3.

9. P(A' Intersect B') = 1 - P(A) - P(B) - P(A Intersect B) = 1 - 0.35 - 0.45 - 0 = 0.2
